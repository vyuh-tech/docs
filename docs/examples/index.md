# Examples Overview

The Vyuh framework has been designed from the ground-up to handle large scale development of features (aka **Mini-Apps**), across multiple distributed teams without falling into the trap of a monolithic App.

It allows you to compose an App out of several Mini-Apps and design all the customer journeys on a CMS. This gives a phenomenal advantage in exploring various journeys and connecting even unrelated mini-apps.

## Chakra

In this section we have built a single App that is composed out of several mini-Apps. This is our own Super App, called the **Vyuh Chakra Demo**.

Each example has a breakdown of how the mini-App was built. Many of them use advanced techniques that are generally seen in production-grade applications.
