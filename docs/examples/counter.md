# Counter

This shows the most fundamental aspect of the Vyuh Framework -- _creating features_. In this example we create a simple feature and expose it on the `/counter` route.

This is the classic Flutter counter example wrapped up in a feature.

An in-depth coverage of this example is done with the [Get Started](/docs/intro/get-started) guide. Take a look over there if you haven't already.
