# Vyuh Content Widget

<PubBadge package="vyuh_content_widget" />

The `vyuh_content_widget` package provides a lightweight widget that can render content from a CMS, relying on the Vyuh ecosystem to provide the content. This is ideal for teams that want to embed CMS-driven content into an existing Flutter app without adopting the full Vyuh Framework.

## Overview

Not every app needs the full Vyuh Framework with its feature system, routing, and plugin architecture. Sometimes you just want to drop a CMS-powered widget into your existing Flutter application. That is exactly what `vyuh_content_widget` provides.

## Key Features

- **Lightweight integration** -- Add CMS-driven content without restructuring your app
- **Content rendering** -- Render structured content items from a CMS
- **Type-safe** -- Full type safety for content deserialization
- **Customizable** -- Provide your own layouts and content builders

## Dependencies

- `vyuh_core` -- Core types and runtime
- `vyuh_extension_content` -- Content type system

## Usage

```dart
import 'package:vyuh_content_widget/vyuh_content_widget.dart';

// Use the VyuhContentWidget to render CMS content
// in any part of your existing Flutter app
class MyExistingApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: VyuhContentWidget(
          query: '*[_type == "myContent"][0]',
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## When to Use

Use `vyuh_content_widget` when you:

- Have an existing Flutter app and want to add CMS-driven content
- Need a lightweight solution without the full framework
- Want to gradually adopt the Vyuh ecosystem
- Need to embed dynamic content in specific parts of your app

For new apps that will be fully CMS-driven, consider using the full [Vyuh Framework](index) with `vyuh_core` instead.
