# Vyuh Extension Content

<PubBadge package="vyuh_extension_content" />

This package provides the core types for integrating with a headless CMS, which includes the Content plugin, the CMS building blocks, and the UI for rendering a route from a CMS.

## Content Plugin

This is the default implementation for the `ContentPlugin`, and it works with a `ContentProvider` to do most of the heavy lifting. The `ContentPlugin` maintains the type registry of all the content items that will be fetched from the CMS, whereas the `ContentProvider` takes care of fetching a single route or fetching specific documents from the headless CMS.

## Descriptor and Builder

This includes the `ContentDescriptor` and the `ContentBuilder` pair that knows how to assemble a content-item once fetched from the CMS. The builder takes care of building a type-registry by assembling the various content-descriptors across the features, allowing the builder to supply a visual representation for the content item at the time of rendering.

Additionally, this package also includes the `ContentExtensionDescriptor` and the `ContentExtensionBuilder` that allows you to manage the content extensions for your App. Every feature that needs to get its content items fetched from a CMS will use a `ContentExtensionDescriptor` to supply all the details of the content items.

## Core Types

Expands the set of core types for Content driven apps by adding `Action` and `Condition` types.

## Key APIs

### ContentExtensionDescriptor

Used within a `FeatureDescriptor` to register content builders for your feature:

```dart
final feature = FeatureDescriptor(
  name: 'my_feature',
  title: 'My Feature',
  routes: routes,
  extensions: [
    ContentExtensionDescriptor(
      contentBuilders: [
        MyCustomContent.contentBuilder,
      ],
    ),
  ],
);
```

### ContentBuilder

Defines how a content type is built and rendered:

```dart
ContentBuilder<MyContent>(
  content: MyContent.typeDescriptor,
  defaultLayout: MyContentDefaultLayout(),
  defaultLayoutDescriptor: MyContentDefaultLayout.typeDescriptor,
)
```

### ContentItem

The base class for all content items fetched from the CMS. Custom content types extend this class and provide JSON deserialization.
