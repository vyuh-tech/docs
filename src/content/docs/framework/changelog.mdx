## Dec 2024 Update

- Added support for **Scoped DI** that allows registering dependencies only at
  the Route level. This avoids polluting the global DI container.
- Several updates to the **Forms** package that supports complex Multi-Step
  forms, validations, custom fields and layouts
- Split the Analytics Plugin into **Telemetry Plugin** + Analytics Plugin.
  Telemetry focuses on logs, metrics and traces whereas Analytics is about
  user-level analytics and tracking User behavior.
- Added a new abstraction called **Modifiers** that allows a Content Item to
  have more complex visual behaviors, such as Themes, Localization, Visual
  Annotations, etc.
- Introduced **Events** for communicating between Features and Plugins. Events
  are type-safe and can be used to build custom events with necessary type-safe
  payloads.
- Complete refresh of the https://vyuh.tech **Website** which is now built with
  Astro
