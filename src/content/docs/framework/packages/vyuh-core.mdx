<PubBadge name="vyuh_core" />

The Vyuh Core package provides the foundation for building Vyuh applications. It includes the core runtime, plugin system, and extension mechanisms that power the framework.

## Core Components

### runApp()
The main entry point for bootstrapping a Vyuh application. It initializes the platform, sets up the plugin system, and starts the application with the specified features. The function handles the initialization sequence, ensuring plugins are loaded in the correct order and features are properly registered before the application starts.

```dart
void runApp({
  required FeaturesBuilder features,
  PluginDescriptor? plugins,
  PlatformWidgetBuilder? platformWidgetBuilder,
  String? initialLocation,
})
```

- `features`: A builder function that returns a Features object configuring app features
- `plugins`: Optional PluginDescriptor specifying plugins (defaults to PluginDescriptor.defaultPlugins)
- `platformWidgetBuilder`: Optional builder for platform-specific widgets
- `initialLocation`: Optional initial route location

### Feature System

#### FeatureDescriptor
A comprehensive descriptor for defining features in a Vyuh application. It encapsulates all aspects of a feature including its metadata, initialization logic, routing, and extensions. Features are the primary building blocks of a Vyuh application, providing modular and reusable functionality that can be composed together. The descriptor ensures features are properly isolated and can be independently developed and tested.

```dart
final class FeatureDescriptor {
  final String name;
  final String title;
  final String? description;
  final IconData? icon;
  final VoidFutureFunction? init;
  final VoidFutureFunction? dispose;
  final List<ExtensionDescriptor>? extensions;
  final List<ExtensionBuilder>? extensionBuilders;
  final RouteBuilderFunction? routes;

  FeatureDescriptor({
    required this.name,
    required this.title,
    this.description,
    this.icon,
    this.init,
    this.dispose,
    required RouteBuilderFunction routes,
    this.extensions,
    this.extensionBuilders,
  });
}
```

## Plugin System

Vyuh uses a plugin architecture to provide core functionality and enable extensibility. Each plugin follows a common interface pattern and can be configured through the PluginDescriptor.

### Core Plugins

#### Content Plugin
The backbone of Vyuh's content management system. It provides a standardized interface for content retrieval, caching, and updates. This plugin is essential for applications that need to manage and display structured content from CMS systems like Sanity.io. Includes both the main plugin interface and a no-op implementation for testing.

#### Authentication Plugin
Manages user authentication and session state. Provides a unified interface for different authentication providers while handling common authentication flows, session persistence, and user state management. Supports anonymous authentication, email/password, phone OTP, and OAuth providers.

#### Navigation Plugin
Powers Vyuh's routing and navigation system. Provides a declarative way to define routes, handle deep linking, and manage navigation state. Includes both the plugin interface and a default implementation using GoRouter.

#### Analytics Plugin
Enables comprehensive user interaction tracking and analytics. Provides a flexible interface for logging events and user properties, supporting multiple analytics providers while maintaining a clean separation between business logic and analytics implementation.

#### Network Plugin
Handles all network communication. Provides a standardized interface for making HTTP requests while supporting features like request interceptors, response caching, and error handling. Includes a default HTTP implementation.

#### Environment Plugin
Manages environment-specific configuration and feature flags. Provides a type-safe way to access environment variables and configuration values, supporting different environments (development, staging, production). Includes both the interface and a default implementation.

#### Telemetry Plugin
Provides comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities. Supports multiple telemetry providers and log levels, enabling detailed application monitoring and debugging. Includes a no-op provider for testing.

#### Dependency Injection Plugin
Manages dependency injection throughout the application. Provides a clean way to register and resolve dependencies. Includes a default implementation using the GetIt service locator.

#### Event Plugin
Handles application-wide event management. Provides a pub/sub system for communication between different parts of the application. Includes both synchronous and asynchronous event handling.

#### Storage Plugin
Manages persistent storage operations. Provides a unified interface for storing and retrieving data across different storage backends.

### Plugin Providers

Each plugin can have multiple providers that implement the actual functionality:

- **Content Providers**: Implement content fetching and manipulation for different backends
- **Analytics Providers**: Implement analytics tracking for different services
- **Telemetry Providers**: Implement logging for different logging systems
- **Auth Providers**: Implement authentication for different auth services

### Default Implementations

Vyuh provides default implementations for most plugins:

- `NoOpContentPlugin`: A no-op implementation of the content plugin
- `DefaultNavigationPlugin`: Default implementation using GoRouter
- `HttpNetworkPlugin`: Default HTTP-based network implementation
- `DefaultEnvPlugin`: Basic environment variable management
- `GetItDIPlugin`: Default dependency injection using GetIt
- `NoOpTelemetryProvider`: No-op implementation for telemetry

## Usage Example

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(
    initialLocation: '/',
    plugins: PluginDescriptor(
      content: DefaultContentPlugin(
        provider: SanityContentProvider.withConfig(
          config: SanityConfig(
            projectId: '<your-project-id>',
            dataset: 'production',
            perspective: Perspective.previewDrafts,
            useCdn: false,
            token: '<your-token>',
          ),
          cacheDuration: const Duration(seconds: 5),
        ),
      ),
      env: DefaultEnvPlugin(),
      auth: MyCustomAuthPlugin(),
      telemetry: TelemetryPlugin(
        providers: [],
      ),
    ),
    features: () => [
      // Core Vyuh features
      system.feature,
      developer.feature,

      // Custom features
      root.feature,
      counter.feature,
      onboarding.feature,
      auth.feature(),
    ],
  );
}
