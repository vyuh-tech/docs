The Vyuh Core package exposes the core types that are required for running the
Vyuh application. This includes the following:

- **runApp()**: the entry point to running a Vyuh Application. This takes in the
  list of features and a list of plugins as arguments. You can also customize
  specific widgets in the framework such as the loaders, error-views and the
  root app-builder.
- **Descriptors & Builders**: the main descriptors for defining a feature
  (`FeatureDescriptor`) and extension (`ExtensionDescriptor`). Also includes the
  `ExtensionBuilder` type for creating extensions to the framework.
- **Interface types** for the core plugins:
  - Content
  - Analytics
  - Network
  - Logger
  - DI (Dependency Injection)
  - Authentication
  - Navigation
- **CMSRoute**: custom GoRoute subclass that allows deeper customization by
  mapping to a CMS path or supplying custom transitions.
