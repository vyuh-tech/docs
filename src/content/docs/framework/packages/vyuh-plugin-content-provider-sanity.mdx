<PubBadge name="vyuh_plugin_content_provider_sanity" />

[Sanity.io](https://sanity.io) is the default CMS that is used by the Vyuh
framework. This provider allows you to fetch documents from a Sanity dataset
using GROQ queries and render them using the Vyuh framework.

Internally, the provider uses the
<PubBadge name="sanity_client" inline={true} /> for its configuration and makes
connections to the Sanity CDN.
