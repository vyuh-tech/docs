As you have seen so far, managing wonders is much more simpler and consolidated
into a single document on the CMS.

We can easily add more wonders to this list and have them linked up in the CMS
and rendered on the App. Publishing more wonders is now just a matter of
gathering the visual assets, collecting the facts, putting it all into the
wonder document and hitting "**Publish**" on the CMS.

This is the true power of a content-driven workflow and has already been applied
to fairly large scale apps.

With Vyuh, we are redefining the role of a CMS and how it can be used to build
sophisticated content-oriented Flutter Apps. Surprisingly, this type of
content-oriented thinking is not just for apps like Wonderous. A whole gamut of
apps in various industry verticals like Real Estate, Gaming, E-Commerce,
Finance, etc. are amenable as well.&#x20;

By rethinking the App Experience as a projection of rich content, we can take
the control back and remotely deploy changes that can be live to the customers
in minutes! Not days or weeks!&#x20;
