  Collection of several mini-app examples to demonstrate the Vyuh Framework
---

The Vyuh framework has been designed from the ground-up to handle large scale
development of features (aka **Mini-Apps**), across multiple distributed teams
without falling into the trap of a monolithic App.

It allows you to compose an App out of several Mini-Apps and design all the
customer journeys on a CMS. This gives a phenomenal advantage in exploring
various journeys and connecting even unrelated mini-apps.

## Chakra

In this section we have built a single App that is composed out of several
mini-Apps. This is our own Super App, called the **Vyuh Chakra Demo**.&#x20;

Each example has a breakdown of how the mini-App was built. Many of them use
advanced techniques that are generally seen in production-grade applications.
