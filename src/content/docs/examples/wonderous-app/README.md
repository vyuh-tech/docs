![](images/cover.png)

For someone long enough in the Flutter community, it is hard to miss the
**Wonderous App**, a beautiful App built by the talented folks at
[GSkinner](https://flutter.gskinner.com/wonderous/). This is a great example of
a _content-rich_ app showcasing wonders around the world with slick animations.

As you know, the Vyuh Framework was designed to work well with _Content_ of all
kinds, especially where the _CMS-hosted Content_ becomes the centerpiece of your
experience. The Wonderous App fits perfectly with this idea, and we decided to
_rebuild it_ using the Vyuh Framework.

A variety of features from the framework are at play:

1. **Custom content types**
2. **Custom documents** with configurable section-based rendering
3. **Navigation** between pages and templated routing
4. **Custom actions**
5. **API integrations** with Unsplash
6. **Google Maps** integration
7. **YouTube** player

These set of posts will walk you through how it was built and the various
choices made to reimagine the experience with Vyuh.
