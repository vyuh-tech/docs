Traditionally, CMS platforms have been used for creating and managing websites,
but their potential goes far beyond that. At Vyuh, we’re redefining how a CMS
can be leveraged to fully control the App Experience.

As an example, we can customize login journeys, empowering business teams to
manage user authentication without heavy reliance on developers. With a
CMS-driven approach, configuring a login page becomes straightforward.

You can dynamically:

- Enable and manage authentication providers (e.g., Google, Apple).
- Customize layouts, such as prioritizing email-password login, Phone OTP login.
- Define actions like navigation to signup or forgot password pages (With
  customisable validations).

These configurations happen in real-time, ensuring instant updates without any
coding effort. The CMS also allows for seamless control over actions triggered
by user interactions. Whether it’s logging in, signing up, or recovering a
password, everything is managed effortlessly from the CMS.

Underneath, the integration relies on Flutter for implementation, with Firebase
handling authentication and JSON files defining layouts and behaviours. This
ensures a clear separation between the **CMS-driven configurations** and the
technical side, giving business teams full control over user flows. This
approach redefines what CMS platforms can do, extending their capabilities to
create flexible and fully customizable login experiences, all without developer
intervention.
