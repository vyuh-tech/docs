Tired of hitting refresh every time you make a content change in your CMS? Say
goodbye to those tedious days! Vyuh now brings you **Live Content Editing**, a
game-changing feature that lets you see your Sanity CMS content updates in your
Flutter app _instantly_.

## What's the Big Deal?

Imagine this:

1.  You make a content change in the Sanity Studio.
2.  ...and that's it! The change _automatically_ appears in your Flutter app,
    running on your simulator or device.

No more:

- Manually refreshing the app.
- Interrupting your development flow.
- Losing focus on what matters: creating amazing content and user experiences.

Vyuh's Live Content Editing keeps you in the zone, boosting your developer
productivity. It's seriously addictive once you start using it!

## How Does It Work?

Vyuh leverages a new `Live Content API` integration to enable real-time updates
across the board for Vyuh-based apps connected to Sanity CMS. This means your
app stays in sync with your content, always.

> This can work in both development and production environments. In production,
> you would have to publish your content before they show up on the customer
> devices.

Enabling is as simple as turning on the `useLiveRoute` flag on the
`DefaultContentPlugin`.

```dart {6} title="main.dart"
import 'package:vyuh_core/vyuh_core.dart';
import 'package:vyuh_extension_content/vyuh_extension_content.dart';

void main() async {
  final plugins = PluginDescriptor(
    content: DefaultContentPlugin(
      useLiveRoute: true,
      provider: SanityContentProvider.withConfig(
        config: SanityConfig(
          projectId: '<your-project-id>',
          dataset: 'production',
          perspective: Perspective.previewDrafts,
          useCdn: false,
          token: '<your-token>',
        )
      )
    )
  );

  vyuh.runApp(
    initialLocation: '/demo',
    features: () => [
      system.feature,
      developer.feature,
      // ... other features ...
    ],
    plugins: plugins,
  );
}

```
