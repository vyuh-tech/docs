The Vyuh framework has been a powerful framework for building CMS-driven Flutter
apps. It allows you to connect with any of your CMS providers and work with a
variety of third-party integrations and plugins to build your enterprise-grade
application. However, building with the framework requires you to adopt it from
the ground up, and sometimes that is not an idle scenario. You may have an
existing app that is already using a lot of the functionality from your existing
ecosystem, and all you need is a widget that can render content from the CMS.

Well, that is about to be changed with the **`Vyuh Content Widget`**.

## Vyuh Content Widget

Introducing the Vyuh Content widget which allows you to render CMS content
directly inside your existing application all through a **Widget**. This greatly
simplifies the need for adopting a framework like Vyuh and instead focuses on
rendering just a widget which pulls content from the CMS.

As your needs increase, you can adopt the full Vyuh framework that gives you lot
more functionality for working with the CMS and also organizing your features in
a modular fashion.
