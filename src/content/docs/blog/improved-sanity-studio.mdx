We've greatly improved the **Sanity Studio** experience for working with many
features, including documents that are exported by different features.

This change gives you a more **organized view** of your features, allowing you
to explore things easily. It keeps the system documents (like routes,
conditional-routes, categories, and regions) in one place, which are quickly
reachable, and also documents which are feature-specific, organized according to
features.

We think the overall experience makes it easier to scale your projects across
multiple features.
