Rendering documents from the CMS has been a bit of a challenge in the past,
where you had to create custom content items and then manage the whole process
of fetching the content from the CMS and rendering it on Flutter. Now this has
been greatly simplified with three new content items that have been introduced:
Document View, Document List View, and Document Section View. With these, you
should be able to manage the entire presentation of a list of documents or
individual documents with as many detailed sections as you want.

### `DocumentView` and `DocumentSectionView`

These two content-blocks unlock a new range of capabilities for easily rendering
CMS Documents with the Vyuh Framework. This can apply to domains like:

- **Education** - showing courses and chapters
- **Real Estate** - showing properties
- **Conferences** - showing events and sessions
- **Retail** - showing Product detail pages
- **News & Media** - showing articles, columns, blogs
- **Restaurants** - showing menus

A quick demo can be seen below:

### `DocumentListView` to render a set of documents from the CMS

Right on the heels of the `DocumentView` and `DocumentSectionView`, we now have
the third pillar: the `DocumentListView`. With this you can render a list of
documents from a CMS with a custom query and render it the way you please. Using
the layout, you can also control the container that renders all these documents.

In short, phenomenal control and flexibility, without the hassle.

Now, render away your docs easily. ðŸš€.

This completes the triad for rendering docs from a CMS ðŸ”±

1. `DocumentView`
2. `DocumentSectionView`
3. `DocumentListView`

You can now _tackle all scenarios of master-detail rendering_, a super common
scenario in CMS-driven apps.
