Welcome to the new companion to the Vyuh framework - a CLI.

The Vyuh CLI is your new command-line companion to create new projects,
features, and schemas for the Vyuh Framework.

The previous method of using Mason to generate your project, feature, schemas,
will now be deprecated in favor of the CLI. If you have been using the Mason
setup, life just got a bit more easier ðŸ˜Š

With the CLI, you'll be able to do all scaffolding with a simple command that
you can add to your global pub. To read more about how to do this and set it up
for creating new projects, head over to the README for the CLI.
