The Vyuh framework has been in the works for a couple of months. We are now
ready with a `v1.0` that has some of the core capabilities for building
_CMS-driven Flutter apps_.

## What is Vyuh? In a nutshell...

Vyuh is a framework for building Flutter Apps with a CMS driving most of the App
Experience. This is a new paradigm of building apps where you split the
responsibility of creating the user journeys, content of different screens
entirely from the CMS and do it via configurations exposed by your
content-schemas (aka `configurations`). The implementations of those
configurations come to life on the Flutter side when rendered on the device or
the simulator.

### CMS-driven

The CMS and Flutter combination of building apps gives you a powerful way of
prototyping different types of user-journeys, screen content, and also carrying
out A/B testing, all from the comfort of your CMS Studio.

### Modular features

Additionally, you get the benefit of organising your application features in a
modular fashion. This allows you to combine features in unique ways and also
build a family of **vyuh**-enabled apps by moving features atomically between
these applications. Features can also contribute different types of content,
layouts, actions, and conditions that can all be combined and configured on the
CMS.

> The use of modularity has been a huge part of the development of Vyuh. This
> allows going from a simple app to a complex Super App that has disparate
> features that span across a variety of business functions.

### Plugins

Almost every app requires a core set of capabilities (such as authentication,
analytics, logging, networking, error management, showing loaders, feature
flagging, etc.). All of these capabilities are exposed in the form of plugins in
the Vyuh framework, allowing any feature to rely on these plugins and do things
like opening up a login dialog from anywhere in your application.

Plugins are also extensible, and you can build custom plugins that do unique
things for your application which are cross-cutting across the app.

## Sounds interesting?

We encourage you to take a look at the [Documentation](https://docs.vyuh.tech)
and explore building Vyuh apps. Currently, [Sanity.io](https://sanity.io) is our
default CMS. We will add support for other CMS-es depending on enterprise needs.
