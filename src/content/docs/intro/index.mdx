description: Introduction to the Vyuh Framework
---

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

Vyuh is a framework for building _modular, large scale_ **Mobile** and **Web**
apps (aka _Super Apps_). It uses **Flutter** to drive the App Experience and an
_optional_ **Server-Driven UI** using a headless **CMS**.

> It is a tried and tested approach for building **Super Apps** as a collection
> of **modular Mini-Apps**. Vyuh allows you to create a _single unified App
> Experience_ that can connect multiple mini-apps.

This CMS-driven approach helps in **dramatically reducing your time** üïõ to ship
new features with a **much smaller team** üòá.

It also gives **phenomenal control** üéõÔ∏è in switching things and trying different
variations of a journey or content.

It unlocks new ways of **exploring UI Development** üåà which is fun, flexible
and dynamic.
