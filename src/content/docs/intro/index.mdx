Vyuh is a framework for building _modular, large scale_ **Mobile** and **Web**
apps (aka _Super Apps_). It uses **Flutter** to drive the App Experience and an
_optional_ **Server-Driven UI** using a headless **CMS**.

> It is a tried and tested approach for building **Super Apps** as a collection
> of **modular Mini-Apps**. Vyuh allows you to create a _single unified App
> Experience_ that can connect multiple mini-apps.

<div className={'flex flex-row items-center justify-center'}>
  <Image src={vyuhLogo} alt={'Vyuh Logo'} width={128} height={128} />
</div>

This CMS-driven approach helps in **dramatically reducing your time** üïõ to ship
new features with a **much smaller team** üòá.

It also gives **phenomenal control** üéõÔ∏è in switching things and trying different
variations of a journey or content.

It unlocks new ways of **exploring UI Development** üåà which is fun, flexible
and dynamic.

<Aside title={'Ready to Scale'} type={'tip'}>
  A framework that can take you from Idea to MVP to Production Scale. Makes the
  simple stuff easy and complex stuff possible with ease!
</Aside>

## Fundamentals covered

This is possible because the framework takes care of all the fundamentals of
building large scale apps. This includes things like:

- **CMS**-driven (aka _Server-driven_) UI

<Aside title={'CMS is Optional'}>

Vyuh works with a headless CMS like **Sanity.io** out-of-the-box. However, the
CMS piece is **completely optional** and you can include it as and when you need
it. In fact, it supports different levels of granularity where you can have the
entire app driven through a CMS, a single page rendered from a CMS, or even a
component coming from a CMS.

The extent of usage is up to you, and you can start by not having it at all
inside your application
