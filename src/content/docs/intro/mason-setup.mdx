[Mason](https://github.com/felangel/mason) is a tool that uses a template and
generates the files needed for your projects. By using simple parameters such as
a `name`, `title` and other details of your project, mason can scaffold the
initial project structure quickly.

This is possible with **bricks**. A _brick_ is a template that can be expanded
by Mason to generate the final file or project structure. Let's setup mason and
configure it to use the bricks from Vyuh.

## 1. Add Mason

The first step is to activate the
[mason_cli](https://pub.dev/packages/mason_cli) package globally. This gives you
access to the `mason` command that can be used to generate the initial
structure. Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
dart pub global activate mason_cli
```

In the folder where you plan to build your _mono-repo_ project for the Vyuh
Application, run the following:

```bash
mason init
```

The above command should have created a `mason.yaml` file in that folder.

## 2. Add the Vyuh related bricks

Replace the contents of `mason.yaml` with below:

```yaml
# Register bricks which can be consumed via the Mason CLI.
# Run "mason get" to install all registered bricks.
# To learn more, visit https://docs.brickhub.dev.
bricks:
  vyuh_init:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/vyuh-tech/bricks
      path: vyuh_init
  vyuh_feature:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/vyuh-tech/bricks
      path: vyuh_feature
  vyuh_feature_sanity_schema:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/vyuh-tech/bricks
      path: vyuh_feature_sanity_schema
```

Next, in the same folder, run the following command to fetch all the bricks:

```shell
mason get
```

## 3. Create your project with Mason

It is finally time to scaffold our project. We can use the `vyuh_init` brick and
create the project:

```bash
mason make vyuh_init
```

This will generate the complete project structure that is essential to build the
Vyuh App. For more details about what this project structure looks like, refer
to the guide on [Typical Project Structure](/guides/typical-project-structure).

## Explore other bricks

In addition to the vyuh_init brick, there are also bricks for:

- **vyuh_feature**: scaffolds a single Vyuh feature package in Flutter
- **vyuh_feature_sanity_schema**: scaffolds a single schema package in
  TypeScript for working with the Sanity CMS.

The process to use them is similar to the one used before. For example, to
scaffold a new Feature package, you can run the following command:

```shell
mason make vyuh_feature
```

### Custom output folder

By default Mason generates the files in the folder where you run the command. To
create it inside a specific folder, you could pass in the **`-o`** flag with the
relative directory. This is particularly useful when generating features.

For example, to generate the feature package inside the **`./features`** folder
of your root project directory, you would run the following:

```bash
mason make vyuh_feature -o features
```

## Summary

This guide showed you the steps to setup **mason** on your system and use it to
generate various parts of the Vyuh Application. Currently, there is support for
creating a new Vyuh App, a Vyuh Feature package for Flutter and a Vyuh schema
package for Sanity CMS.

There will be more added in the future to accommodate other aspects of
developing Vyuh Apps.
