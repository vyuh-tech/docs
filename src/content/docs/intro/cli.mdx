import { PubBadge } from '@/components/PubBadge'

The Vyuh CLI is a new tool that allows you to quickly scaffold projects,
features, and schemas for the Vyuh framework. It is built on top of the `Mason`
package and includes a few other utilities to make it easier to generate
projects and features.

<Aside type={'note'} title={'PNPM and Melos'}>

The Vyuh CLI internally uses `pnpm` and `melos` to manage the packages for the
schema and feature packages. This is to ensure that the packages are managed in
a consistent way across all the projects.

it's a good idea to have `pnpm` and `melos` installed globally. To read more
about how to do it, refer to these links:

- [Setup PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [Setup Melos](https://melos.invertase.dev/getting-started)

</Aside>

## Activate the Vyuh CLI

The first step is to activate the <PubBadge name="vyuh_cli" inline /> package
globally. This gives you access to the `vyuh` command that can be used to
generate the initial structure. Run this command in your terminal:

```shell
dart pub global activate vyuh_cli
```

<Aside type={'tip'} title={'Adding to Shell Path'}>

If you want to use the `vyuh` command from anywhere in your terminal, you can
add the Dart pub global executables to your shell path. This is usually done by
adding the following line to your shell profile file (like `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`
or `.config/fish/config.fish`):

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label={'Bash, Zsh'}>

    ```shell
    export PATH="$HOME/.pub-cache/bin:$PATH"
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label={'Fish'}>

    ```shell
    set PATH "$HOME/.pub-cache/bin:$PATH"
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

After adding this line, you can run the `vyuh` command from anywhere in your
terminal.

A similar setup is required for those running on **Windows**.

### Create your new project

<Aside type={'note'} title={'Prerequisites'}>

The Vyuh CLI needs some additional programs to be installed for it to work
properly. These are opinionated choices and ensures a consistent development
environment across all projects. Please ensure these are installed and available
on your shell path:

- [**pnpm**](https://pnpm.io/installation) - for managing the mono-repo with the
  NPM schema packages.
- [**melos**](https://melos.invertase.dev/getting-started) - for managing the
  mono-repo with feature packages, written in Dart.
- [**Sanity CLI**](https://www.sanity.io/docs/getting-started-with-sanity-cli) -
  for building CMS-driven UI and creating a new Sanity project. Please ensure
  you have also logged into Sanity using the `sanity login` command.

</Aside>

In the folder where you plan to build your _mono-repo_ project for the Vyuh
Application, run the following. The `<project_name>` tag is the one where you
should specify your own name for the project.

```bash
vyuh create project <project_name>
```

The above command will create a complete folder structure under `<project-name>`
which is described in more detail in the
[Project Structure](/guides/project-structure) article.

### More parameters

There are more details you can pass when creating the project as shown below:

```text title="Create Project" {3}
A Vyuh Flutter project created by Vyuh CLI.

Usage: vyuh create project <project-name> [arguments]
-h, --help                Print this usage information.
-o, --output-directory    The desired output directory when creating a new project.
    --description         The description for this new project.
                          (defaults to "A Vyuh Flutter project created by Vyuh CLI.")
    --cms                 The content management system for this new project.
                          (defaults to "sanity")
    --org-name            The organization for this new project.
                          (defaults to "com.example.vyuh")
    --application-id      The bundle identifier on iOS or application id on Android. (defaults to <org-name>.<project-name>)
```

## Add a new feature

Just like the command for creating projects, we also have a
`vyuh create feature <feature-name>` that does very similar things in terms of
setting up a new feature for the project.

This will create a new feature package (_in Flutter_) inside the current folder
of your shell.

```text title="Create Feature" {3}
Create a new Vyuh feature.

Usage: vyuh create feature <feature-name> [arguments]
-h, --help                Print this usage information.
-o, --output-directory    The desired output directory when creating a new feature.

Run "vyuh help" to see global options.

```

## Add a new schema

We also have the command for creating a new schema for the CMS. You can use
`vyuh create schema <feature-name>` to set it up.

This will create a new schema package (_in Typescript_) inside the current
folder of your shell.

```text title="Create Schema" {3}
Create a new Vyuh feature CMS schema.

Usage: vyuh create schema <feature-name> [arguments]
-h, --help                Print this usage information.
-o, --output-directory    The desired output directory when creating a new feature.
    --cms                 The content management system for this new schema.
                          (defaults to "sanity")

Run "vyuh help" to see global options.

```

<Aside title={'Custom output folder'}>

By default the CLI generates the files in the folder where you run the command.
To create it inside a specific folder, you could pass in the **`-o`** flag with
the relative directory. This is particularly useful when generating features.

For example, to generate the feature package inside the **`./features`** folder
of your root project directory, you would run the following:

```bash
vyuh create feature "new-feature" -o features
```

Don't worry about passing space-separated words inside your feature name. The
tool automatically takes care of converting it to a proper_snake_case when it
generates the feature. For the previous command, the name "new-feature" will
result in creating a folder called `new_feature` inside the `features`
directory.

</Aside>

## Update the CLI

The Vyuh CLI has an inbuilt mechanism to update itself. You can run the
following command to update the CLI:

```shell
vyuh update
```

This will check for the latest version of the CLI and update it if necessary.

```shell
> vyuh update
âœ“ Checked for updates (0.7s)
CLI is already at the latest version.

```

## Summary

This guide showed you the steps to set up the **Vyuh CLI** on your system and
use it to generate various parts of the Application. Currently, there is support
for creating a new Vyuh App, a Vyuh Feature package for Flutter and a Vyuh
schema package for Sanity CMS.

There will be more added in the future to accommodate other aspects of
developing Vyuh Apps.
