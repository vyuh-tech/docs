## Technical Documentation, examples, guides and resources for the Vyuh Framework

# Overview

## What is Vyuh?

Vyuh is a framework for building _modular, large scale_ **Mobile** and **Web**
apps (aka _Super Apps_). It uses **Flutter** to drive the App Experience and an
_optional_ **Server-Driven UI** using a headless **CMS**.&#x20;

> It is a tried and tested approach for building **Super Apps** as a collection
> of **modular Mini-Apps**. Vyuh allows you to create a _single unified App
> Experience_ that can connect multiple mini-apps.

This CMS-driven approach helps in **dramatically reducing your time** 🕛 to ship
new features with a **much smaller team** 😇.&#x20;

It also gives **phenomenal control** 🎛️ in switching things and trying different
variations of a journey or content.&#x20;

It unlocks new ways of **exploring UI Development** 🌈 which is fun, flexible
and dynamic.

> #### A framework that can take you from Idea to MVP to Production Scale. Makes the simple stuff easy and complex stuff possible with ease!

## Fundamentals covered

This is possible because the framework takes care of all the fundamentals of
building large scale apps. This includes things like:

- **CMS**-driven (aka _Server-driven_) UI
- Custom Content types
- Actions, Layouts, Conditions, Routes
- Custom API Content
- Custom journeys & Conditional flows
- **Modular** development of **Features** with independent teams
- Third party integrations via **Plugins**
- **Remote configuration** with Zero App Store releases
- **Design System** based UX
- **Analytics**
- **Feature Flags** and A/B/N testing
- **Networking**
- **Authentication**
- Navigation and **Routing**
- **State Management** with the sophistication you desire
- **Error Handling**
- **Theming**
- **Storage** and Secure Storage
- and much, much more...
