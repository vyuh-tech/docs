The source of all Presentation is **Data**; yet most of the industry tooling is
geared towards _Screen Design_ rather than **Content (aka Data) Design**. This
seems a bit misplaced, because in every other field of communication,
**`Content`** is hailed as King, yet the treatment in terms of tooling is not at
par with that sentiment!

The _Vyuh Framework_ embraces the idea of **Content driven Experience**, where
you design the structure of the Content, with a thin layer of hints to allow
building the Presentation layer. Hence the design of features with the Vyuh
Framework generally starts from building the design of _**Structured Content**_.

## Growing set of Principles

After having built a variety of features (aka Mini-Apps) across a wide range of
verticals such as Fashion, Finance, Retail, Healthcare, Real Estate, Flights,
Hotels, Delivery and many others, we have observed a few principles that help in
effective development of Mini-Apps. These are listed below, in no particular
order.

1. Naming is crucial. **DO** take your time to pick the right name that conveys
   the most meaning and intent. This applies to fields, objects, documents,
   classes, methods, packages and even Apps.
2. **DO** use the jargon from the Business Domain
3. **DO NOT** introduce presentation attributes into a Content Schema. For
   example, a `Card with Image` is a better way to imply the final rendering
   without mentioning details of the _border-radius, shadows, colors, fonts_,
   etc. Strive to keep the content pristine without muddying it with
   presentation related attributes.
4. **DO** emphasize on correct spellings of field names. Eg: Use **subtitle**
   and not _subTitle_ or _SubTitle_. Subtitle is a single word without a change
   in casing for the letter **T** of title.
5. **DO** find existing content items and rely on them before defining newer
   content-items. A classic example is of creating a `Button` content block
   instead of using the **`Card`** with a custom Button Layout.
6. When the content-item is a fundamental part of the jargon, **DO** have a
   separate content-item instead of reusing existing ones. For example, if you
   are showing Movie details on a card, it is better to create a custom
   `Movie Card` item instead of reusing the default `Card`. Stay true to the
   semantics and business jargon used in the domain of the Mini-App. This is a
   corollary to the principle in 2.
7. **DO** use the CMS purely for configuration and hide implementation details
   from it. The typical person of a CMS studio is a Content Author who wants to
   focus on the Content rather than its presentation. There are times when the
   presentation differences matter, eg: Mobile vs Desktop. In those cases,
   create a Conditional Layout for that item with the configuration differences.
8. **DO NOT** generalize schemas unless you have seen two to three instances of
   similarity. Refactoring into a common schema too soon has its perils and
   results in too much of _if-else_ conditions in code later on. It is better to
   wait for patterns of similarity to emerge before the big refactor.

## Presentation Principles with Flutter

The principles listed below are applicable for all Flutter apps. However, in the
context of Vyuh, they make even more sense as it gives greater flexibility with
the configuration coming from a CMS.

1. **DO** start with a _Design System_ when building your Mini-Apps. A DS will
   help you be more consistent with your UI across all the screens.
2. **DO** divide the content-type that has lots of fields into a set of _related
   sections_. Then allow rendering the content by sections. This gives
   configurability on the CMS to reorder sections, add/remove sections and even
   style them differently using different layouts.
3. **DO** reuse the _default content types_ like Card, Group, PortableText,
   Accordion with possibly different layouts to get going faster.
4. **DO** use the _layout configuration_ as an opportunity to provide a
   different design variant for the content type. A Content Type can have one of
   many layouts and can be changed for different screens.
5. **DO** keep your _widget trees shallow_. Break up large widgets into smaller
   more semantic widgets for easier maintainability.
6. **DO** keep the _naming of the Widgets_ in sync with the business domain.

 **Keeps Evolving**

The above principles are what we have applied so far. This will keep evolving as
we tackle more varieties of use cases in the future.
