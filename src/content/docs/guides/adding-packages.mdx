When adding packages to your Dart projects, there are two ways in which these
packages can be referenced inside your `pubspec.yaml`.

## Adding a package from pub.dev

To add a package from [pub.dev](https://pub.dev), you can simply add the package
name to the `dependencies` section of your `pubspec.yaml` file.

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  vyuh_core: ^1.0.0
```

For a list of all the packages which are publicly available on `pub.dev`, refer
to the [article on packages](/framework/packages).

## Adding a package from the Enterprise Package Registry

Adding a package from the private pub registry requires you to set up a token
for the hosted provider. You will get this `token` during the onboarding process
for the enterprise plan. Once you have this token, you can add the hosted
provider as below.

<Steps>

1.  **Keep the details handy**

    Keep the details of the hosted provider handy. You will need the URL of the
    hosted provider and the token to authenticate the requests. Let's capture
    these in these variables for rest of the steps:

    - `<token>`: secret token to authenticate requests to the hosted provider
    - `<private-pub-registry>`: URL of the hosted provider

1.  **Add the hosted provider**

    Use the `<token>` given to you during the onboarding stage and enter that as
    your secret token.

    ```shell
    dart pub token add https://<private-pub-registry>
    Enter secret token: <Type token on stdin>
    Requests to "https://<private-pub-registry>" will now be
    authenticated using the secret token.
    ```

      For more details on how to add a token, refer to the official Dart
      documentation on [adding a
      token](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/cmd/pub-token).
    </Aside>

1.  **Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml`**

    You can now add the package from the hosted provider like so:

    ```shell
    dart pub add --hosted-url=https://<private-pub-registry> <package-name>
    ```

    An easier way is to just copy this snippet for each enterprise package and
    paste into your `pubspec.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    <package-name>:
      hosted: https://<private-pub-registry>
      version: ^1.0.0
    ```

1.  **Bootstrap with Melos**

    Now when you run `melos bootstrap` inside your project, the package will be
    fetched from the hosted provider.

</Steps>

## Summary

This guide covers how to add packages from both the public and private package
registries. The private package registry requires you to set up a token for the
hosted provider. Once done you can add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` and
run `melos bootstrap` to fetch the package.
