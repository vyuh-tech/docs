Events are a way to get notified of important lifecycle events in the Vyuh
Framework as well to communicate between features.

The framework leverages a built-in `EventPlugin` to handle the propagation of
events. It is a global event system that even allows features to communicate
with each other. The event plugin can be referenced with `vyuh.event`.

## Listening for Events

To listen for an event, you can use the `on` method on `vyuh.event`. The
`on<T>()` method is a generic method based on the type of the Event and takes a
typed-listener that matches the generic type. The method returns a disposer
function that be invoked at a later point to cancel the event listener.

A typical place to set up an event-listener would be in the `init` method of a
feature.

```dart title="feature.dart" showLineNumbers {6-8}
final feature = FeatureDescriptor(
  name: 'root',
  title: 'Vyuh Root Feature',
  description: 'The root feature for the Vyuh Demo app',
  init: () async {
    final disposer = vyuh.event.on<SystemReadyEvent>((event) {
      print('System is ready');
    });

    // At a later point, invoke the subscription disposer to cancel the event listener
    disposer();
  },

  // rest of the feature configuration
);

```

<Aside type="tip">
With the `on` method, you can listen for multiple events by skipping the Type
specifier.

```dart
final disposer = vyuh.event.on((event) {
  print('${event.runtimeType} event received');
});

```

### Listening for Events Once

You can listen to the events just once with the `once` method. This will remove
the listener after the first time the event is triggered. Using the previous
example of the `SystemReadyEvent`:

```dart
vyuh.event.once<SystemReadyEvent>((event) {
  print('System is ready');
});
```

The once methods also support listening to multiple events without specifying a
type.

```dart
vyuh.event.once((event) {
  print('${event.runtimeType} event received');
});
```

## Triggering Events

To trigger an event, you can use the `emit` method on `vyuh.event`. The `emit`
method emits a type-safe event that is a subclass of `VyuhEvent`. Here is a
simple example where the SystemReadyEvent is emitted:

```dart
vyuh.event.emit(SystemReadyEvent());
```

Elsewhere in the framework, the `SystemReadyEvent` is defined like so:

```dart
final class SystemReadyEvent extends VyuhEvent<void> {
  SystemReadyEvent() : super(name: 'vyuh.event.systemReady');
}
```

### `VyuhEvent`

The `VyuhEvent` class is the base class for all events in the Vyuh Framework. It
is a generic class that takes a type parameter that represents the payload of
the event. The payload can be any type or `void` if the event does not have a
payload.

The `name` of the event is a string that uniquely identifies the event. It is
very common to use a reverse domain name notation for the event name.
Additionally, the event class has a `timestamp` that represents the time when
the event was created.

```dart
class VyuhEvent<T> {
  final String name;
  final DateTime timestamp;
  final T? data;

  VyuhEvent({
    required this.name,
    this.data,
  }) : timestamp = DateTime.now();
}
```

### Standard Events

Currently, there is only one standard event in the Vyuh Framework:

- **`SystemReadyEvent`**: This event is triggered when the system is ready to
  start the application. It is a good place to initialize the application
  features.

### Custom Events

You can create custom events by extending the `VyuhEvent` class. Here is an
example of a custom event that carries a payload of type `String`:

```dart
class CustomEvent extends VyuhEvent<String> {
  CustomEvent(required super.data) : super(name: 'com.example.customEvent');
}
```

The custom event can be triggered like so:

```dart
vyuh.event.emit(CustomEvent('Hello, World!'));
```

## Event Propagation

The event system in the Vyuh Framework is a global event system. The event
propagation is synchronous and happens in the order of the event registration.

When an event is emitted, the event plugin iterates through all the event
listeners and invokes them in the order they were registered. As mentioned
earlier, you can cancel the event listener by invoking the disposer function
returned by the `on` method.

## Summary

Events are a powerful way to communicate between features in the Vyuh Framework.
The event system is a global event system that allows features to listen to
events and communicate with each other. The event system is synchronous and
propagates events in the order of registration.
