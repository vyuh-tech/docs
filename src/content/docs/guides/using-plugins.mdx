  Making use of the cross-cutting Plugin API for invoking various capabilities
---

Plugins as discussed in the
[Features and Plugins](/concepts/features-and-plugins) article, is all about
cross-cutting functionality that is available to all features. Think of it as
the Frontend brain for the User-facing feature. The classic example is the
Authentication plugin. It allows you to invoke auth operations like `login`,
`logout` without worrying about the UI. The authentication feature provides the
UI and invokes the **auth** plugin (via **`vyuh.auth`**) as per the User events.

This separation of Plugins into their own space allows features to focus more on
the presentation and less on the plumbing used to achieve the user-facing
functionality.

## Setting Up Plugins

The Vyuh framework has built in plugins for most of the common scenarios. This
helps you to get started quickly without configuring all of them at the
beginning. However, as you start building more complex apps, it would be
required to setup custom plugins and integrations that are suited for your app.

This is done as part of the **`runApp()`** call, from the **`vyuh_core`**
package. Here is an example of the invocation with the various plugins.

```dart title="lib/main.dart" showLineNumbers {2,33,45,56,58,59}
void main() async {
  final plugins = await _getPlugins();

  vc.runApp(
    initialLocation: '/demo',
    features: () => [
      system.feature,
      news.feature,
      developer.feature,
      tmdb.feature,
      food.feature,
      onboarding.feature,
      wonderous.feature,
      firebase_auth.feature(),
      misc.feature,
      forms.feature,
    ],
    plugins: plugins,
    ),
  );
}

_getPlugins() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  await Firebase.initializeApp(options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform);

  // Ensure all imperatively navigated URLs are shown in the URL bar
  DefaultNavigationPlugin.enableURLReflectsImperativeAPIs();
  DefaultNavigationPlugin.usePathStrategy();

  return PluginDescriptor(
    content: DefaultContentPlugin(
      provider: SanityContentProvider.withConfig(
        config: SanityConfig(
          projectId: '<project-id>',
          dataset: 'production',
          perspective: Perspective.previewDrafts,
          useCdn: false,
          token: '<token>',
        ),
        cacheDuration: const Duration(seconds: 5),
      ),
    ),
    analytics: vc.AnalyticsPlugin(
      providers: [
        FirebaseAnalyticsProvider(),
      ],
    ),
    telemetry: vc.TelemetryPlugin(
      providers: [
        vc.ConsoleLoggerTelemetryProvider(),
        SentryTelemetryProvider(
          config: SentryProviderConfig(
            sampleRate: 0.2,
            dsn: '<dsn>',
          ),
        ),
      ],
    ),
    auth: FirebaseAuthPlugin(),
    others: [
      FirebaseFeatureFlagPlugin(
        settings: RemoteConfigSettings(
          fetchTimeout: const Duration(seconds: 10),
          minimumFetchInterval: const Duration(seconds: 10),
        ),
      ),
    ],
  );
}

```

In the above code-block, we are using a variety of custom configured plugins:

- **Content**: configured with the Sanity provider
- **Navigation**: using the `GoRouter` package
- **Analytics**: uses Firebase Analytics, Performance and Crashlytics
- **Feature Flag**: using Firebase Remote Config
- **Logger**: the built-in console logger
- **Authentication**: using Firebase Auth

## Available Plugins

There are many built-in plugins available in the Open Source plan and many more
are being added for the Enterprise plans. These plugins fall into the following
categories:

| **Category**         | **API**            |
| -------------------- | ------------------ |
| Content              | `vyuh.content`     |
| Network              | `vyuh.network`     |
| Authentication       | `vyuh.auth`        |
| Navigation           | `vyuh.router`      |
| Dependency Injection | `vyuh.di`          |
| Environment          | `vyuh.env`         |
| Analytics            | `vyuh.analytics`   |
| Telemetry            | `vyuh.telemetry`   |
| Feature Flag         | `vyuh.featureFlag` |
| Logger               | `vyuh.log`         |
| Events               | `vyuh.event`       |

We also plan to introduce new categories in the future that caters to
simplifying various aspects of the Application. An example could be _User
Feedback_.

## Using the `ContentPlugin`

The `ContentPlugin` is one of the core plugins in the Vyuh Framework, accessible
via the `vyuh.content` API. It allows you to interact with the CMS content and
render it on the Flutter widget.

It also takes care of registering various types that are found during the
deserialization process of reading the JSON content from CMS. This helps in
ensuring that you have a type-safe Dart object when working inside your Flutter
code. Some of the core responsibilities of the Content plugin include:

### Content Building

Content can be rendered with the `buildContent()` and `buildRoute()` methods.
The Content building APIs can be used while constructing custom layouts and can
also be used directly if needed.

> `buildContent()` internally works with the `ContentBuilder` to use the correct
> layout configured in the `ContentItem`. Below you can see a simple
> **`FoodMenuItem`** (subclass of `ContentItem`) being rendered in a Flutter
> Widget. The `item.description` contains PortableText content.

```dart {17}
final class FoodItemHero extends StatelessWidget {
  final FoodMenuItem item;

  const FoodItemHero({super.key, required this.item});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final theme = Theme.of(context);

    return Column(
      crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
      children: [
        Text(item.title, style: theme.textTheme.headlineMedium),
        Text('${item.calories.toInt()} calories'),
        Padding(
          padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: theme.spacing.s20),
          child: vyuh.content.buildContent(context, item.description),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

```

You can also build the content directly by passing in an instance of a specific
`ContentItem`. This is useful when dealing with `APIContent` items that render
data from an API. Here is an example of a simple _WonderItem_ being rendered
from an API call:

```dart {12-26}
import 'package:vyuh_feature_system/vyuh_feature_system.dart' as vf;

class _WonderItem extends StatelessWidget {
  const _WonderItem({
    required this.document,
  });

  final WonderMiniInfo document;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return vyuh.content.buildContent(
      context,
      vf.Card(
        title: document.title,
        description: document.subtitle,
        image: document.icon,
        action: vc.Action(
          configurations: [
            NavigationAction(
              url: '/wonderous/wonder/${document.identifier}/details',
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

```

### Type Registrations

- Types can be registered and checked with the `register()`, `isRegistered()`
  methods.
  > You would generally not need to use these methods directly unless you are
  > building a very custom `ContentItem` with a `ContentBuilder` that leverages
  > custom `ContentDescriptor`.
- Deserialization when reading content from CMS.
- Most of the work of the Content plugin is delegated to the `ContentProvider`,
  which takes care of fetching content from the CMS. Once the data is ready, the
  Content plugin can take over in rendering it on the Flutter widgets.

## Using the `NavigationPlugin`

This plugin can be accessed using the `vyuh.router` API. The navigation plugin
allows you to navigate within the application by pushing and popping routes. Th
e plugin internally uses the `GoRouter` package to do all the navigation. If you
are familiar with the `GoRouter` package, there is nothing new that this plugin
is doing besides just wrapping the methods (`go()`, `push()`, `pop()`,
`replace()`, etc.)

> The advantage of using this plugin is that it also calls the analytics plugin
> (`vyuh.analytics`) wherever needed to track page transitions and send across
> to the `AnalyticsProvider`.

Here is an example of a Widget that uses the vyuh.router to push a specific
route:

```dart {4}
PhotoCard(
  photo: photo,
  showStats: true,
  onTap: () => vyuh.router.push('/unsplash/home/photos/${photo.id}'),
)
```

## Using the `NetworkPlugin`

This plugin can be accessed using the `vyuh.network` API. It's a wrapper around
the `HTTPClient` and allows you to make network calls for all the HTTP verbs
(GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, etc.). The advantage of using this
plugin is that it creates a singular HTTP client that is useful across the
application. This avoids creating multiple copies per feature.

The network API is typically useful when creating API clients for your own
bespoke or third-party APIs. Here's an example of using it with the TMDB API.

```dart
Future<GenresListResponse> genres() async {
  final response = await vyuh.network.get(apiUrl('genre/movie/list'));

  final data = jsonDecode(response.body);
  return GenresListResponse.fromJson(data);
}
```

## Using the `DIPlugin`

Accessible via the `vyuh.di` API. The Di plug-in is useful for injecting shared
dependencies within a feature or even across features. This is a core plugin
that allows you to manage stores and services that are required within a feature
or across features.

Typically, when you are building a feature, you would do all the DI
registrations inside the `init()` method of the feature. This puts all the
dependencies on the global DI container.

However, there might be situations where you would like to have the dependencies
only use the scope of a single route. For such scenarios, you can use the Scoped
DI, which is accessible inside the `RouteLifecycleConfiguration` for the route.
The lifecycle handler is invoked during the `init()` and `dispose()` of
individual routes, thus giving you a distinct time-boundary within which the
dependencies are active. Note that the Scoped-DI Container for the Route is
automatically reset when refreshing a route.

Depending on your needs, you can choose to put your dependencies on the global
container or the scoped container.

Here is an example of the TMDB feature that uses the `init()` to register some
feature-level dependencies:

```dart {8-10}
final feature = FeatureDescriptor(
  name: 'tmdb',
  title: 'TMDB',
  description:
      'Uses the TMDB API to show details of movies with ability to favorite and add to watchlists',
  icon: Icons.movie_creation_outlined,
  init: () async {
    vyuh.di.register(TMDBClient(vyuh.env.get('TMDB_API_KEY')));
    vyuh.di.register(TMDBStore());
    vyuh.di.register(TmdbSearchStore());
  },

  // rest of the feature config
);
```
