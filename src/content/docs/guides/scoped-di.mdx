Dependencies can be managed within the Vyuh framework using a Dependency
Injection (DI) container. We use [GetIt](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it)
internally as our default plugin for managing DI. The plugin itself can be
referenced with `vyuh.di` and can be used to set up and lookup dependencies.

However, all the dependencies that you're creating are managed at a global
level. This means we have a single DI container globally in which you put all of
your dependencies.

Sometimes it may be necessary that some of the dependencies are only at specific
**route levels**. As long as the route is active, you want the dependencies to
be active. _Implicitly, the lifetime of the dependencies is linked with the
lifetime of the route_.

To manage such a scenario, we have introduced the concept of a **Scoped DI**.
This allows you to create a scoped-DI container for a widget-subtree within
which you can manage your dependencies. Currently, the default support exists
for a Route, but you can also apply this scoping for your own widget trees.

This keeps your dependencies local to the route (or Widget), and if you look up
a dependency within that widget tree, it will first try to find something at the
`Route` level (or your own `Widget` level). If it doesn't find it, then it goes
to the global container (`vyuh.di`) as a fallback.

## Looking up scoped dependencies

You can look up a scoped dependency using the `context.di` API. The `context.di`
looks up a scoped DI-container up the widget ancestry and finds the nearest one
. If none is found, it will fall back to `vyuh.di`. In any case, you will be
able to look up a dependency either locally within the tree or go up the
hierarchy until you find the one inside the global container.

> Note that you do need the `context` parameter to look up the scope-di
> container. This is by design, as you only want this lookup to happen within a
> widget tree.

Notice the use of `context.di` to look up the `TestStore` from the scoped di
container.

```dart showLineNumbers title="layout.dart" {2,14}
Widget build(BuildContext context, Card content) {
  final title = context.di.get<TestStore>().title;

  final theme = Theme.of(context);

  return f.Card(
    child: Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
      child: Column(
        crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
        children: [
          Text('The below text is read from a Route-Scoped DI Store',
              style: theme.textTheme.labelSmall),
          Text(title,
              style: theme.textTheme.titleMedium?.apply(
                fontWeightDelta: 2,
                color: theme.colorScheme.primary,
              )),
        ],
      ),
    ),
  );
}

```

## Setting a scoped dependency

Since the scope dependency is very limited to the Route, there has to be a way
to inject the dependencies just at the time of initializing the route. We do
this with the use of the `RouteLifecycleConfiguration`.

This lifecycle configuration can be set up at the CMS level, or you can also do
it explicitly if you are managing the route locally within your code.

The `RouteLifecycleConfiguration` has the `init(BuildContext, RouteBase)` and
`dispose()` methods which are invoked whenever the route is about to be
initialized or about to be disposed. This is a perfect opportunity for you to
set up scoped-dependencies since you also have access to the `context` within
the `init()` method. Let's see how this is done for the `TestStore`.

```dart showLineNumbers title="lifecycle.dart" {8,22-24 }
final class TestStore {
  final String title;

  TestStore(this.title);
}

@JsonSerializable()
final class DIRegistrationLifecycleHandler extends RouteLifecycleConfiguration {
  DIRegistrationLifecycleHandler()
      : super(schemaType: 'misc.lifecycleHandler.diRegistration');

  static const schemaName = 'misc.lifecycleHandler.diRegistration';
  static final typeDescriptor = TypeDescriptor(
      schemaType: schemaName,
      fromJson: DIRegistrationLifecycleHandler.fromJson,
      title: 'DI Registration Lifecycle Handler');

  factory DIRegistrationLifecycleHandler.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) =>
      _$DIRegistrationLifecycleHandlerFromJson(json);

  @override
  Future<void> init(BuildContext context, RouteBase route) async {
    context.di.register(TestStore('Hello Scoped DI'));
  }

  @override
  Future<void> dispose() async {}
}

```

Typically, you will setup these lifecycle handlers within the CMS, as shown in
the image below. This is done in a `Route` where such dependencies are needed.

<Image src={routeLifecycleImage} alt={'Route lifecycle setup'} />

You would also need to register the `TypeDescriptor` for the lifecycle-handler
inside the Feature. Notice how this is done within the `RouteDescriptor` using
the `lifecycleHandlers` property.

The `init()` of the lifecycle-handler is automatically invoked as part of the
`Route` deserialization.

```dart showLineNumbers {11-16}
final feature = FeatureDescriptor(
  name: 'misc',
  title: 'Misc',
  description:
      'Miscellaneous feature showing all capabilities of the Vyuh Framework.',
  icon: Icons.miscellaneous_services_outlined,
  // ...
  extensions: [
    ContentExtensionDescriptor(
        // ...
        RouteDescriptor(
          lifecycleHandlers: [
            SimulatedDelayLifecycleHandler.typeDescriptor,
            DIRegistrationLifecycleHandler.typeDescriptor,
          ],
        ),
    ),
  ],
);

```

  The scoped DI container is automatically reset whenever the route is
  refreshed.

## Summary

The introduction of the **Scoped-DI** container gives you new abilities to
localize your dependencies within a route. This avoids polluting the global DI
container and also takes care of cleaning up the dependencies after they're
done.

By linking the lifetime of the dependencies to the lifetime of your route, you
get better memory management, better performance and makes your routes more
efficient.
