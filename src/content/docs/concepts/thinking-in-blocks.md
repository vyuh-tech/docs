  A mindset for building Vyuh Apps assembled with different Content Blocks
---

Vyuh is an innovative framework designed to revolutionize the way developers
build Flutter applications. Unlike traditional methods, Vyuh focuses on a
content-based approach that leverages the power of modularity and a dynamic
Content Management System (CMS). This framework leverages the power of
_**blocks**_ enabling developers to create highly flexible and maintainable
applications by decomposing them into distinct features and content blocks.

## Traditional method

**Traditional Flutter Development Approach**

In a traditional Flutter development approach, applications are often built in a
monolithic fashion. This means:

1. **Monolithic Structure**: The entire application is typically a single
   codebase where features and content are tightly coupled.
2. **Hard-Coded Journeys**: User journeys and interfaces are hard-coded,
   requiring code changes for updates or modifications.
3. **Limited Modularity**: While Flutter encourages some level of component
   reuse, the overall structure remains monolithic, making it difficult to
   isolate and update individual features or content on the fly.
4. **Static Content**: Content is usually static and embedded directly into the
   app, leading to frequent code updates and redeployments. This delays the time
   to market of a feature to the customer.
5. **Team Co-ordination**: Requires high amount of co-ordination between teams
   to ensure no one is impacting the overall codebase or stepping on each other.

## Vyuh's Approach

**Vyuh's Content-based Approach**

Vyuh shifts the paradigm from a monolithic development approach to a more
modular, feature-based, content-block driven approach. Here's how:

1. **Feature-Based**: Vyuh promotes the decomposition of applications into
   independent, reusable and transferable features. Each feature represents a
   logical unit of customer-facing functionality.
2. **Dynamic Content Control**: Instead of hard-coding user journeys and
   screen-content, Vyuh allows these to be managed dynamically via an external
   CMS. This enables real-time updates and modifications without requiring app
   redeployment.
3. **Enhanced Modularity**: By breaking down the app into smaller, manageable
   features, Vyuh enhances modularity. Each feature can be developed, tested,
   and updated independently.
4. **Separation of Concerns**: This approach enforces a clear separation between
   the app's structure and its content, leading to cleaner, more maintainable
   codebases. The presentation is controlled from Flutter, driven by the content
   coming from a cloud-hosted headless CMS.
5. **Team Independence**: Since features can be developed and even tested
   independently, it reduces the co-ordination between teams and allows them to
   operate at full speed.

| **Content Management** | **Static**, hard-coded within the app                          | **Dynamic**, managed via external CMS with Content Blocks              |
| **User Journeys**      | **Fixed**, hard-coded in the app                               | **Dynamic**, controlled through CMS                                    |
| **Modularity**         | **Limited**, requires deliberate effort to split into packages | **High**, enhanced through reusable blocks                             |
| **Flexibility**        | **Low**, requires redeployment for updates                     | **High**, real-time updates through CMS                                |
| **Explorative Power**  | **Low**, requires code changes to try different variations     | **High**, make real-time changes and switch variants with live preview |
| **Team Co-ordination** | **High**, to ensure minimal impact of changes                  | **Low**, since development happens independently                       |

## **Mindset for Building Vyuh Apps**

Building applications with Vyuh requires a shift in mindset from traditional
development practices. Developers need to think in terms of independent content
blocks rather than a single, cohesive codebase. Here are key points to adopt
this mindset:

- **Modular Design**: Think of your application as a set of independent features
  (aka mini-apps). Every feature should only expose Content-blocks (aka
  Components) and avoid having pre-defined journeys.
- **Dynamic Content Management**: Embrace the flexibility offered by the CMS.
  Plan for dynamic content updates and user journey modifications. Design blocks
  to be adaptable to changes from the CMS without requiring code changes.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Maintain a clear separation between the
  applicationâ€™s content and its presentation. Treat the CMS as the primary
  source of truth for content and user journeys. Leverage a Design System to
  create the Flutter equivalents of the content coming from the CMS.
- **Configuration vs Implementation**: Design the content schemas with the
  principles of _structured-content_ without muddying it with presentation or
  implementation details. CMS is purely for business-level configuration. The
  nitty-gritty details of implementation and presentation must be kept on the
  Flutter side.
- **Reusability**: Design blocks with reusability in mind. Aim to create blocks
  that can be reused across different parts of the application or even in
  different applications.

## Summary

By moving away from monolithic structures and embracing feature-based blocks,
developers can build more flexible, maintainable, and scalable applications. The
dynamic control over user journeys and content through a CMS further enhances
the capabilities of Flutter apps, making Vyuh a powerful framework for modern
app development.
