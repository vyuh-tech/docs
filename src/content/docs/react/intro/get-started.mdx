  Framework

import { Aside, LinkCard, TabItem, Tabs } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'
import { NpmBadge } from '@/components/NpmBadge'

The easiest way to get started with Vyuh for React is to clone our template
repository, which comes pre-configured with all the necessary packages and
setup:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vyuh-tech/vyuh-react-workspace.git my-vyuh-project
cd my-vyuh-project
pnpm install
```

After cloning and installing dependencies, you'll need to generate a Sanity project inside the studio folder of apps. For detailed instructions on setting up Sanity with your Vyuh project, please refer to the [Set Up Sanity CMS](/react/intro/setup-sanity) guide.

Take some time to go through the README file in the repository to understand the overall structure and workflow.

The template repository includes examples of how to use the Vyuh framework with
React and Sanity.

## About the Template Repository

The Vyuh React Workspace is a modern, feature-based React application workspace
built with Next.js and Sanity CMS integration. It provides a structured approach
to building scalable React applications with a focus on feature modularity.

### Project Structure

The workspace follows a monorepo structure using PNPM workspaces:

```
vyuh-react-workspace/
├── apps/                      # Application packages
│   ├── main-app/              # Main Next.js application
│   │   ├── app/               # Next.js app directory
│   │   ├── plugins/           # Application-specific plugins
│   │   └── ...
│   └── studio/               # Sanity Studio (generated after setup)
├── features/                  # Feature packages
│   └── misc/                  # Example "Miscellaneous" feature
│       ├── react-feature-misc/    # React implementation
│       ├── sanity-schema-misc/    # Sanity schema definition
│       └── ...
├── packages/                  # Shared packages
└── pnpm-workspace.yaml        # PNPM workspace configuration
```

### Key Components

- **Main Application**: A Next.js app located in `apps/main-app/` that serves as
  the entry point and integrates all features
- **Sanity Studio**: Located in `apps/studio/` after you generate it, providing
  content management capabilities
- **Features**: Modular components in the `features/` directory, each with React
  implementation and Sanity schema definition
- **Miscellaneous Feature**: An example feature included in the template that
  demonstrates the Vyuh framework's capabilities

### Development Workflow

After setting up the repository as described above, you can:

1. Start the main app: `cd apps/main-app && pnpm dev`
2. Start the Sanity Studio: `cd apps/studio && pnpm dev`

For detailed information about the repository structure, configuration, and
usage instructions, please refer to the README file in the repository and the
documentation available at
[https://github.com/vyuh-tech/vyuh-react-workspace](https://github.com/vyuh-tech/vyuh-react-workspace).

The Vyuh framework includes a host of functionality for building custom
features, with actions, conditions, layouts for different content items and also
custom plugins. We'll explore all of these as we expand our documentation.

## What's Next?

Now that you've cloned the template repository and installed the dependencies,
you're ready to explore and build a CMS-driven application with the
miscellaneous feature:
